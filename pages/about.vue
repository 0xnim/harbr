    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Founded in 2020, Modrinth was created to provide modders with an open and
      intuitive platform to publish their mods on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our primary goal is to be as open as possible, with all our code being
      Open Source, while giving back to the modding community as much as
      possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      While we still are in early alpha, we hope we can soon be a major modding
      platform for all modders :)
