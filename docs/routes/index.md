## Overview

Omorphia is Modrinth's component, style, and utility library for Svelte projects. It includes:

- 🧩 Typed components which enhance HTML elements and provide a consistent UI
- 🎨 CSS classes to easily style elements with a coherent style
- 🧰 Typed utilities to solve common tasks quick and dependably
- ⚙️ Configuration for SvelteKit and PostCSS to simplify setups
- 🚚 A Rollup plugin to generate a cache of heavily used API requests and OpenAPI types

Omorphia is used in [Knossos](https://github.com/modrinth/knossos) (modrinth.com) and [Theseus](https://github.com/modrinth/theseus) (Minecraft launcher).

It uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to deliver the best performance with the least boilerplate.
